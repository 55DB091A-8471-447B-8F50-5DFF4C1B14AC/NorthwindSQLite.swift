# northwind-SQLite3
This is a copy of Microsoft's old Northwind database. All the TABLES and VIEWS from the MSSQL-2000 version have been converted to Sqlite3 and included here. Also included are two version prepopulated with data, a small verison and a large version. Should you decide to, you can use the included python script to pump the database full of more data.
